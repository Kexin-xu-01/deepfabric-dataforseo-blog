- **Notebook:** `dataforseo-dag-analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with analysis, DAG visualization, and exploratory steps used in the article.
- **Dataset:** `dataforseo-dataset-graph.jsonl` — The main dataset generated from the configuration file `spin-dataforseo.yaml` and the topic graph file `dataforseo-topic-graph.jsonl` as JSONL records.
- **Topic Graph:** `dataforseo-topic-graph.jsonl`,  — Topic graph generated from the configuration file `spin-dataforseo.yaml` using the --topic-only method.
- **Mock data:** `dataforseo-mock-data.json` — Small mock dataset used for local testing and examples of the SPIN DataForSEO service that is served by Docker
- **Schema:** `dataforseo-schema.yaml` — YAML schema describing record structure, fields, and types generated by deepfabric from the DataForSEO MCP Server, used to mock the MCP service inside the SPIN framework and used for Claude Code to generate a mock tool response calls for the SPIN service against which DeepFabric will interact when generating data.
- **Loader script:** `load-dataforseo-mock-data.sh` — Shell script that loads the mock tool response calls into the docker served local DataForSEO SPIN service
- **DeepFabric Configuration File:** `spin-dataforseo.yaml` — Configuration file for DeepFabric holding configuration for generating topic graphs and the dataset from the topic graph and local DataForSEO SPIN service
- **Notes:** `README-ClaudeCode.md` — Claude-code generated summary of its work when creating the mock tool responses
